# MHSFirst
Redesign of mhsfirst.org

Created in August of 2016 immediately after I got home from my two week "internship" (very informal) at WTE Solutions, where I worked on websites. Abandoned later that school year because robotics started, and needed to focus on that. Was going to continue during FRC season 2018, but coaches wanted something that could be easily edited, so I handed it over to Program Management. Please note that this website was stopped halfway through and everything having to do with loging in should be ignored, as many ignorant mistakes were made, such as storing passwords in plain text (I was not even a sophomore yet). Soon after I saw computerphile's video about it and realized the monstrosity I had created. I'm in the process of uploading all of my old code just so that I can look back on it in the future, so that is why this is here.
